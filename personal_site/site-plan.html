        Welcome to Doctor Doom’s Encyclopedia, a fan-made site dedicated to the fast-growing competitive shooter Marvel Rivals. 
        Released in 2024, Marvel Rivals is still a relatively new title, but it has quickly gained a strong following thanks to its dynamic gameplay, 
        destructible environments, and diverse roster of iconic Marvel heroes and villains. The game blends team-based action with character-driven abilities 
        in a way that appeals to both Marvel fans and players of competitive games. This site was created to help players better understand the game’s evolving 
        landscape — not just in terms of how to play, but why certain characters and strategies rise to the top. Rather than being a traditional wiki or stat sheet, 
        this site provides focused insight into what’s happening in the current meta and which character types are having the biggest impact. Here, you’ll find quick lore 
        summaries of popular heroes, breakdowns of gameplay strategies that are currently shaping matches, and overviews of core character roles. Whether you’re just starting
         out or are already grinding matches, this site is designed to provide concise, helpful information with a Marvel-inspired theme. It’s built for fans who want to deepen 
         their understanding of the game without getting overwhelmed by patch notes or raw data.

      <h3>Metas</h3>
      <p>One of the best ways to understand Marvel Rivals is to learn how its characters are divided into different types. Each hero 
        belongs to a broad category that defines their role in battle. The four most common roles are Tank, Damage (DPS), Support, and Hybrid. 
        Tanks are designed to soak up damage, block enemy progress, and hold frontline positions. They usually have high health pools, defensive abilities, 
        and crowd control tools. These characters are critical for team-based fights and objective control.Damage (DPS) characters are the offensive core of any team. 
        Their job is to eliminate threats quickly, apply pressure, and often burst down high-value targets. Some DPS heroes focus on long-range combat, while others 
        specialize in close-quarters brawling.Support characters provide healing, shields, buffs, or other utility that helps their team survive and stay mobile. 
        While they may not deal as much damage, their presence is often what separates a good team from a great one.Hybrids mix traits from multiple roles. 
        Some blend tanky durability with utility, while others offer healing and damage. These flexible picks add depth to team comps and reward skilled play. 
        Understanding these types helps players build balanced teams and better anticipate how matches unfold.</p>

      <h3>Characters and Types</h3>
      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Week 08 - change this -->
        In competitive games like Marvel Rivals, the term “meta” refers to the most effective tactics available — 
        strategies and team compositions that are popular because they perform well under current game conditions. 
        The meta is constantly evolving due to balance updates, new character releases, and community experimentation. 
        One widely used strategy is the dive composition. Dive teams are built around fast, mobile characters that can quickly eliminate key targets. 
        They thrive on momentum and aggression, often overwhelming enemies before they can react. These teams work best when coordinated and typically 
        focus on disrupting backlines and supports.Another emerging trend is the flying character meta, where mobility and vertical advantage allow heroes 
        to control fights from above. Characters with flight or high mobility can access areas that grounded players struggle to reach, giving them strong 
        positioning and escape options. These heroes are often difficult to deal with, forcing teams to rethink their targeting and movement strategies. 
        Some players instead rely on zoning or control comps, which focus on locking down space and forcing enemies into bad positions. These teams often play 
        slower but excel at defending objectives. Understanding the current meta helps players adapt, stay competitive, and enjoy deeper strategic gameplay.
