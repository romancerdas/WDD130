        <h1>Team Composition - Flyers</h1>
        <p>Flying team compositions focus on heroes with high vertical mobility and aerial control. 
           These teams dominate the skies, making it difficult for enemies to maintain positioning or escape. 
           Flyers can flank from unexpected angles and pressure grounded heroes, forcing teams to adapt their tactics 
           and target priority.</p>

        <h1>Team Composition - Dive</h1>
        <p>Dive compositions use fast, mobile heroes to aggressively break through enemy lines and eliminate 
           key backline targets. These teams thrive on speed and coordinated attacks, catching opponents off guard 
           and dismantling defensive positions. Dive comps rely heavily on teamwork and precise timing to succeed.</p>

      <h2>What is a "meta"?</h2>
      <p>In competitive games like Marvel Rivals, the term “meta” refers to the most effective tactics available — 
        strategies and team compositions that are popular because they perform well under current game conditions. 
        The meta is constantly evolving due to balance updates, new character releases, and community experimentation. 
        One widely used strategy is the dive composition. Dive teams are built around fast, mobile characters that can quickly eliminate key targets. 
        They thrive on momentum and aggression, often overwhelming enemies before they can react. These teams work best when coordinated and typically 
        focus on disrupting backlines and supports. Another emerging trend is the flying character meta, where mobility and vertical advantage allow heroes 
        to control fights from above. Characters with flight or high mobility can access areas that grounded players struggle to reach, giving them strong 
        positioning and escape options. These heroes are often difficult to deal with, forcing teams to rethink their targeting and movement strategies. 
        Some players instead rely on zoning or control comps, which focus on locking down space and forcing enemies into bad positions. These teams often play 
        slower but excel at defending objectives. Understanding the current meta helps players adapt, stay competitive, and enjoy deeper strategic gameplay.</p>
